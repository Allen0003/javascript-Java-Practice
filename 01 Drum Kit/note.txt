7. let (local) vs var (global) and const (final)

"let" allows you to declare variables that are limited in scope to the block, statement, or expression on which it is used. This is unlike the "var" keyword, which defines a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope.

"const" you have values that you dont want changed or that will never change
